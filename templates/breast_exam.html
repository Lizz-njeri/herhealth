    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Step 1: Visual Inspection</h2>
        <p>Stand in front of a mirror and look for any visible changes such as lumps, swelling, or skin changes. Raise your arms above your head and inspect again for any changes.</p>

        <h2>Step 2: Manual Inspection</h2>
        <p>Use the pads of your fingers to examine your breasts in a circular motion. Start from the outermost part of the breast and work your way in. Do this while standing up and lying down.</p>

        <h2>Step 3: Check for Abnormalities</h2>
        <p>Pay attention to any lumps, unusual pain, skin changes, or nipple discharge. If you find anything unusual, consult with a healthcare professional immediately.</p>
